## Abstract 
A color palette is one of the simplest and most intuitive descriptors that can be extracted from images or videos. This paper proposes a method to assess the similarity between color palettes by sorting colors. While previous palette similarity measures compare only colors without considering the overall palette combination, we sort palettes to minimize the geometric distance between colors and align them to share a common color tendency. We propose dynamic closest color warping (DCCW) to calculate the minimum distance sum between colors and the graph connecting the colors in the other palette. We evaluate the proposed palette sorting and DCCW with several datasets and demonstrate that DCCW outperforms previous methods in terms of accuracy and computing time. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed sorting technique by conducting a perceptual study, which indicates a clear preference for the results of our approach. We also demonstrate useful applications enabled by DCCW, including palette interpolation, palette navigation, and image recoloring.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites 

Our code is executed on top of the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. Please go to the [official docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you don't already have Docker installed on your system.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuziKim/DCCW.git
cd DCCW 
```

### Downloade the Dataset
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuziKim/DCCW-dataset.git experiments/DCCW-dataset
```


### Docker Setup
This repository provides a Dockerfile for setting up all dependencies. You can build and run a docker image by yourself.
```bash
mkdir user_data
docker-compose up --build
```

Now you can access ```localhost``` and see the DCCW website locally.
